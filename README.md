# Preprocessing_Passenger-Satisfaction-Dataset
This project is about pre-processing a large survey dataset measuring passengers’ satisfaction in an airline . In this project we investigate different methods for handing outlier, dealing with missing data, scaling/transforming data, and feature selection.

The first section belongs to providing data visualization and providing some descriptive statistics of the data.
The second part is concerned with dealing with outliers and missing data.
In the third part we examine the effects of different data scaling/transforming techniques. 
In the fourth section performance of different dimensionality reduction/feature selection methods is evaluated.
In the fifth part we implement decision tree and random forest classifiers to explore the performance of models and obtain the most important features in determining the passenger’s satisfaction. Additionally, in this section we evaluate the performance and different classification models along with an Ensemble model containing the models.
