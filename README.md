# Preprocessing_Passenger-Satisfaction-Dataset
This project is about pre-processing a large survey dataset measuring passengersâ€™ satisfaction in an airline . In this project we investigate different methods for handing outlier, dealing with missing data, scaling/transforming data, and feature selection.

The first section belongs to providing data visualization and providing some descriptive statistics of the data.
The second and third part is concerned with dealing with outliers and missing data. 
In the fourth section performance of different dimensionality reduction/feature selection methods is evaluated.
